# Introduction.
This is a report on the sales performance of a manufacturing company. The analysis was done by gathering data specific to the company sales in CSV format. These tables "customers table, employees table, product table, order_details table, shippers, categories table, and order table" were imported into PowerBI. To prepare the data for analysis, I used the PowerQuery tool to transform it before carrying out the actual analysis.

Disclaimer This is not a real company as we know that adventure works DW database is compiled by Microsoft for learning purposes.

# Problem Statement
  The goal of this analysis is to :

  - Determine the current market demand for products and how it varies by region/location
  - Know the current sales performance of employees how it compares to past performance and industry benchmarks
  - identify the areas where sales performance is lacking or could be improved.
  - To discover target markets or goods that have the greatest impact on sales success.
  - Finally, the goal is to create data-driven plans that can aid in increasing sales, improving customer happiness, and driving corporate growth.
    
# Skills and Competence Displayed
  PowerBI concepts like:

    - creating columns for calculations for Revenue, Net Sales, Discount granted and Discontinued products
    - Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations,
    - Developing general DAX calculations that deal with text and numbers,
    - Performed advanced DAX calculations for solving statistical measures and other mathematical formulas
    - Data Modelling,
    - Measures,
    - filters,
    - tooltips,
    - Page buttons,
    - Data Visualization
    
# Data Source

The data used for this work is gotten from my project work. 

## Data Transformation

The raw dataset in CSV format were uploaded to the power query editor, where the tables were cleaned and transformed for analysis and visualization purpose.

I tranformed the data in Power Query, checked for Column quality, consistent or appropriate data types.
I began writing several Dax and creating measures and calculated columns to get the right metrics for the Sales Performance analysis.
I also created Measures in a table named "DAX Measures".

Tables were automatically joined by creating relationships with them, PowerBI does this intelligently. However, as someone who understands the dataset and want to get specific insights and information. I had to re-create other relationships and measures to aid my visualization process. I created a model specific for my analysis. 

# Data Analysis and Visualization
Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at the desired KPI or Metrics.
I arrived at a report with
   - Sales Page

# Features of the Report
The Sales page contains information regarding sales.

# Analysis

  - There was an exponential increase in revenue between 2013 and 2014 and a decline in 2015.
  - About 10% of the products were discontinued from production.
  - United package a shipping company made the most revenue from freight.
  - The most revenue was made by employees in the United States.
  - The top markets are in the Americas and North Europe.

# Recommendation

In the three-year study, there was downward movement, with a decline in values from 2013, followed by a spike in sales in April 2015 dip in May. 

   - Strategies to increase the sales should be made like "discounted bundle-selling" where for any purchase of product with unit quantity higher than 40
   - Use database to gather customer feedback to get their experiences about the product or services. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement.
   - Understand Customers purchasing pattern by carrying out an analysis on this. This will tell what customers are buying, when they are buying and how to promote the goods to the customers.

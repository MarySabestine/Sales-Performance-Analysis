# Sales-Performance-Analysis
This Project shows my ability to analyze data in CSV format, thereafter using PowerBI to import, analyze and visualize (The picture below is gotten from startups.co.uk website)

# Introduction
This is a report on the sales performance of a manufacturing company. The analysis was done by gathering data specific to the company sales in CSV format. These tables "customers table, employees table, product table, order_details table, shippers, categories table, and order table" were imported into PowerBI. To prepare the data for analysis, I used the PowerQuery tool to transform it before carrying out the actual analysis.

Disclaimer This is not a real company as we know that adventure works DW database is compiled by Microsoft for learning purposes.
# Problem Statement
  The goal of this analysis is to

    - Determine the current market demand for products and how it varies by region/location
    - Know the current sales performance and how it compares to past performance and industry benchmarks
    - identify the areas where sales performance is lacking or could be improved.
    - To discover target markets or goods that have the greatest impact on sales success.
    - Finally, the goal is to create data-driven plans that can aid in increasing sales, improving customer happiness, and driving corporate growth.
# Skills and Competence Displayed
  PowerBI concepts like:

    - creating columns for calculations for dates, time, and duration

# Data Source

The data used for this work is gotten from the AdventureWorks 2019 database 2019. I studied the Schema, Objects related to the Schema, data dictionary and found the right tables for the analysis.
